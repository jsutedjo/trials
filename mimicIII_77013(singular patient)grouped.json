Marked concentric wall thickening of the\n fluid filled esophagus is partially imaged.\n\n Diffuse hypoattenuation of the liver is consistent with fatty infiltration.  A\n 10 mm hypodensity in segment V (2:26) has attenuation characteristics\n consistent with a cyst.  A cluster of smaller hypodensities near the dome\n (2:4) are too small to characterize.  The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands\n appear normal. Hyperdense material within the gallbladder likely represents\n sludge. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally\n without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  The stomach and intra- abdominal loops\n of large and small bowel are of normal caliber, and there is no obstruction.\n Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified, none of\n which meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. The abdominal aorta is of\n normal caliber.  There is no free air. Small amounts of free fluid in the\n paracolic gutters and mesenteric edema represent third spacing.\n\n CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, and prostate are\n unremarkable.

Mildly dilated LV cavity. Normal\nregional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' < 8,\nsuggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient.\n\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\n\nAORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.\n\nAORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No valvular AS. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is related to high cardiac output. No AR.\n\nMITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.\n\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Normal PA\nsystolic pressure.\n\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. No PS.\nPhysiologic PR.\n\nPERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.\n\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.\nThe left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall\nmotion appears normal, but cannot be definitely excluded given the patient's\ncurrent tachycardia. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\nare normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good\nleaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with\ntrivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure\nis normal. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global\nsystolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular disease or\npulmonary hypertension.\n\nFindings consistent with a generalized high-output state (early sepsis,\nanemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral AV shunting, beri-beri, etc.). If\nclinically indicated, would recommend repeating the study when the patient is\nless tachycardic.\n\n\n.

Brought to ED yesterday for near paralysis and\n   was found to have metabolic derangements and quadraparesis bordering on\n   quadriplegia, as described in resident\ns note and other notes above.\n   His LE problems began with progressive edema. Has had care at [**Hospital1 5757**], and also told me that he was told his Na was low and\n   K was high in the past.\n   Key issues:\n     * Has been treated with thiamine and his extremity strength has\n       dramatically improved- now able to raise arms and legs against\n       gravity and very weakly against some resistance\n     * Lactic acidosis, which is characteristic of thiamine deficiency,\n       improving, now 13\n 3 and bicarb 8\n     * Likely refeeding syndrome, phos 2.9\n 0.5\n 1.8, aggressively\n       repleting Phos and Mg\n     * Profound hypoalbuminemia at 2.2\n     * Hypovolemic hyponatremia improving Na 120\n 129\n     * This afternoon became febrile and delirious. Likely EtOH\n       withdrawal. Unclear when was last drink\nEtOH on arrival 110, but pt\n       says 4d ago, unreliable hx. Received valium 5mg x 2 with\n       improvement in dysarthria.\n     * Severe coagulopathy and concern for DIC, monitoring.\n     * Pancultured, CXR unconcerning for pna, on vanc/zosyn and will have\n       low threshold for LP if worsens. No leukocytosis.\n     * I am concerned about resp status given new use of accessory\n       muscles, though I think this may be from sepsis or alc withdrawal.\n       Obtained VC 1900 and NIV -20. Will repeat q 4h or more if nec, and\n       will check ABG as indicated.\n   Critically ill\n   90 minutes\n. Physician wrote a ECG report that says: Sinus tachycardia.

POssibilties would be a combination of his hypoglycemia,\n   alcohol, and most especially acute thiamine toxicity. At this point we\n   are treating with thiamine, supportive care, trend lactate, avoid\n   hypoglycemia.

Physician wrote a Physician  report that says: Chief Complaint:\n   24 Hour Events:\n   [**3-18**] Events:\n   - tachycardia/trembling consistent with withdrawl, started on CIWA with\n   valium 5 mg q2h PRN\n   - spiked to 101, pan cultured, continued vanco/zosyn\n   - received total 4 u PRBCs yesterday\n   - hepatology consulted\n   - neurology consulted\n   - needed phos and mag repletion\n   - echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\n   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional\n   left ventricular wall motion appears normal, but cannot be definitely\n   excluded given the patient's current tachycardia. Overall left\n   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler\n   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure\n   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\n   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\n   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\n   with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The\n   increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\n   output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears\n   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated\n   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial\n   effusion.\n   IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global\n   systolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular\n   disease or pulmonary hypertension.\n   Findings consistent with a generalized high-output state (early sepsis,\n   anemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral AV shunting, beri-beri, etc.).

Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest\n   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia\n   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia\n   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low\n   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.\n   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.\n   # Hypophosphatemia\n given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by\n   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes\n   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in\n   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc\n   nl RR.\n   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until\n   replete.\n   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition.

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, likely severe thiamine\n   deficiency. Treated for withdrawal overnight with valium 5 per CIWA,\n   transfused 4u PRBC yesterday. Febrile to 101.\n   Exam notable for Tm 101 BP 127/60 HR 110 RR 26 with sat 99 on RA.\n   Slender, tremulous man. CTA B, RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Strength improving\n   per report, 3+-4 in B LE. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 25, K+ 3.7,\n   Cr 0.8.\n   Agree with plan to continue supportive care and nutritional repletion\n   while awaiting thiamine levels; lactate has fallen. Echo and overall\n   progression is consistent with high output state associated with\n   thiamine deficiency. He has new acute anemia, will guiac and check\n   hemolysis labs and LFTs as well as following serial HCTs. No clear\n   evidence of infection, will d/c antibiotics if cx neg at 48h.\n   Swallowing is weak, will change to IV formulations and monitor closely\n   with POs.  Continue valium per CIWA for withdrawal.

Regional\n   left ventricular wall motion appears normal, but cannot be definitely\n   excluded given the patient's current tachycardia. Overall left\n   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler\n   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure\n   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\n   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\n   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\n   with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The\n   increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\n   output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears\n   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated\n   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Physician wrote a Physician  report that says: Chief Complaint:\n   24 Hour Events:\n   [**3-18**] Events:\n   - tachycardia/trembling consistent with withdrawl, started on CIWA with\n   valium 5 mg q2h PRN\n   - spiked to 101, pan cultured, continued vanco/zosyn\n   - received total 4 u PRBCs yesterday\n   - hepatology consulted\n   - neurology consulted\n   - needed phos and mag repletion\n   - echo: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses\n   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional\n   left ventricular wall motion appears normal, but cannot be definitely\n   excluded given the patient's current tachycardia. Overall left\n   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler\n   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure\n   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are\n   normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels\n   are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\n   with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The\n   increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac\n   output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears\n   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated\n   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial\n   effusion.\n   IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global\n   systolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular\n   disease or pulmonary hypertension.\n   Findings consistent with a generalized high-output state (early sepsis,\n   anemia, thyrotoxicosis, peripheral AV shunting, beri-beri, etc.). If\n   clinically indicated, would recommend repeating the study when the\n   patient is less tachycardic.\n   - got aggitated overnight, continued on CIWA, low dose haldol did not\n   seem to change his aggitation\n   - doing q4 hr VCs, poor patient effort, from 1900 to 1600;

Does not appear\n   infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**].\n   - protecting airway, if desats would get ABG and evaluate for CO2\n   retaining\n   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement\n   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], will consider MRI\n   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,\n   no signs of fluid overload\n   - metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri beri explains very high\n   initial lactate\n   - also would explain respiratory alkalosis\n   .\n   # Withdrawl:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic\n   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale, requiring ativan q 2 hrs, seems to be\n   improving\n   - cont CIWA\n   - consider haldol for aggitation\n   .\n   # GIB\n appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and\n   minor mouth bleed.\n   -         switching H2 to PPI\n   -         will place NG tube and put on intermittent suction\n   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.\n   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,\n   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver\n   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of\n   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.\n   - liver team following\n   - Viral serologies pending\n   - Autoimmune studies pending\n   - Ceruloplasmin\n   - Social Work Consult\n   - Nutrition Consult\n   # Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal\n   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest\n   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia\n   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia\n   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low\n   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.\n   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.\n   # Hypophosphatemia\n given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by\n   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes\n   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in\n   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc\n   nl RR.\n   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until\n   replete.\n   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC\n   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.\n   - elevated hapto, likely has hemolysis, unclear if has [**Name (NI) 5771**] syndrome\n   in setting of heavy alcohol use. Patient with some blood in mouth from\n   biting tounge, no seizure.\n   - transfuse as neccessary\n   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.\n   - Will follow, improving\n   .\n   # HIV status\n per report recent negative result, rechecking, f/u\n   results today\n   # Access\n 2 IVs\n   .\n   # PPx\n SQ heparin and will start GI ppx\n   .\n   # FEN\n replacing lytes aggressively, nutrition following, does not\n   appear to be in process of a refeeding syndrome\n   .\n   # Communication\n with patient and mom\n   .\n   # Code\n full\n   .\n   # Dispo\n active withdrawl, maybe callout tomorrow\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-3-18**] 03:31 AM\n   20 Gauge - [**2191-3-18**] 04:47 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, likely severe thiamine\n   deficiency p/w profound muscle weakness. Treated for withdrawal\n   overnight with valium 5 per CIWA, anemia has improved with\n   transfusions.\n   Exam notable for Tm 100.6 BP 127/60 HR 110 RR 26 with sat 96 on RA.\n   Slender, tremulous man. CTA B, RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Strength improving\n   per report, 3+-4 in B LE. Labs notable for WBC 5K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7,\n   Cr 0.7.\n   Agree with plan to continue supportive care and nutritional repletion\n   while awaiting thiamine levels; will need LP with FFP x2u to r/o other\n   processes. He has new acute anemia, likely due to GIB. Will follow\n   serial HCTs [**Hospital1 7**] and transition to IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]. No clear evidence of\n   infection, will d/c antibiotics. Swallowing is weak, will change to IV\n   formulations and monitor closely with POs.  Change valium to ativan per\n   CIWA for withdrawal. Will need NGT for nutritional support and for NGL.\n   Remainder of plan as outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 40 min\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 775**], MD\n   on:[**2191-3-20**] 05:16 PM ------\n.

Does not appear\n   infectious, d/c ABx [**3-20**].\n   - protecting airway, if desats would get ABG and evaluate for CO2\n   retaining\n   - continue thiamine and other B vitamins, MVI, folate replacement\n   - neuro following, recs to LP, [**3-20**], will consider MRI\n   - tachycardia and hyperdynamic heart on echo consistent with beri beri,\n   no signs of fluid overload\n   - metabolic lactic acidosis has resolved, beri beri explains very high\n   initial lactate\n   - also would explain respiratory alkalosis\n   .\n   # Withdrawl:  Using ativan instead of valium since decreased hepatic\n   metabolism. Continue CIWA scale, requiring ativan q 2 hrs, seems to be\n   improving\n   - cont CIWA\n   - consider haldol for aggitation\n   .\n   # GIB\n appears to be lower given maroon stools. Patient bit tounge and\n   minor mouth bleed.\n   -         switching H2 to PPI\n   -         will place NG tube and put on intermittent suction\n   # Mild Hepatitis: Best etiology appears to be mild alcoholic hepatitis.\n   Other differential includes viral, drug mediated, vascular, autoimmine,\n   or Wilsons.  Hepatomegaly without splenomegaly suggests early liver\n   disease in acute exacerbation in the setting of EtOH. CT suggestive of\n   fatty infiltration. Tox screen negative, EtOH level 110. CMV negative.\n   - liver team following\n   - Viral serologies pending\n   - Autoimmune studies pending\n   - Ceruloplasmin\n   - Social Work Consult\n   - Nutrition Consult\n   # Hyponatremia: no ascites on exam to suggest cirrhois and portal\n   hypertension.  Also patient not overloaded on exam to suggest\n   hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Initial thought is hypovolemic hyponatremia\n   given relative hypotension and tachycardia vs. euvolumic hyponatremia\n   caused by beer potomania. Urine electrolytes are consistent with a low\n   FeNA of a hypovolemic state.\n   - Bolus with D5NS and recheck lytes.\n   # Hypophosphatemia\n given the rapid onset, appears to be caused by\n   refeeding syndrome. In alcholics, total body hypophosphatemia causes\n   exaggerated response to glucose administration. Will replete stores in\n   dilute IV form before restarted D5. Not caused by hyperventilation bc\n   nl RR.\n   -          will replete aggressively, and hold D5 for now until\n   replete.\n   # Coagulopathy: likely due to liver failure and poor nutrition. DIC\n   also a possibility. Gave Vitamin K 5mg PO X1.\n   - elevated hapto, likely has hemolysis, unclear if has [**Name (NI) 5771**] syndrome\n   in setting of heavy alcohol use. Patient with some blood in mouth from\n   biting tounge, no seizure.\n   - transfuse as neccessary\n   #Elevated Lipase: could be from subclinical alcoholic pancreatitis.\n   - Will follow, improving\n   .\n   # HIV status\n per report recent negative result, rechecking, f/u\n   results today\n   # Access\n 2 IVs\n   .\n   # PPx\n SQ heparin and will start GI ppx\n   .\n   # FEN\n replacing lytes aggressively, nutrition following, does not\n   appear to be in process of a refeeding syndrome\n   .\n   # Communication\n with patient and mom\n   .\n   # Code\n full\n   .\n   # Dispo\n active withdrawl, maybe callout tomorrow\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren Pulmonary (Full) - [**2191-3-20**] 11:21 PM 30 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-3-18**] 03:31 AM\n   20 Gauge - [**2191-3-18**] 04:47 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n.

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, likely severe thiamine\n   deficiency p/w profound muscle weakness. Treated for withdrawal\n   overnight with ativan per CIWA, blood loss anemia has improved with\n   transfusions. Started low dose lasix for element of volume overload.\n   Exam notable for Tm 99.6 BP 120/70 HR 110 RR 22 with sat 97 on RA.\n   Slender, tremulous man. CTA B, RRR s1s2. Soft +BS. Strength diminished,\n   3 in B LE. Labs notable for WBC 6K, HCT 26, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.7, INR 2.2,\n   lipase 808.\n   Agree with plan to continue supportive care and nutritional repletion\n   while awaiting thiamine levels; will need MRI and LP to r/o other\n   processes once INR<2. Prognosis of his weakness unclear, this may be\n   his new baseline. Will get PT/OT involved today and d/w neuro role of\n   neuromuscular evaluation. For GIB, will follow serial HCTs [**Hospital1 7**] and\n   continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]. Swallowing is weak, will continue IV meds and TFs.\n   His lipase is elevated though he is asymptomatic. We will continue\n   feeding for now and recheck in AM. If still elevated, will need to\n   transition to bowel rest or postpyloric feeds. Continue ativan per CIWA\n   for withdrawal. Will use lasix IV today for mild volume overload.\n   Remainder of plan as outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 40 min\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 775**], MD\n   on:[**2191-3-21**] 01:00 PM ------\n.

He was also treated for alcohol withdrawal (appears\n   quiescent now), blood loss anemia, and volume overload.\n   On exam he is interactive and on room air, sitting up in chair.  Breath\n   sounds decreased at left base. Strength is antigravity in legs,\n   somewhat more than antigravity in arms.\n   Agree with plan to continue supportive care and nutritional repletion\n   while awaiting thiamine levels.  MRI of brain and spine are complete;\n   formal report pending.  LP deferred due to ongoing coagulopathy.  Will\n   hold SQ heparin; if PTT not decreased will consider mixing study and\n   other evaluation.  Greatly appreciate neurology\ns help with ongoing\n   evaluation and management of weakness.  PT/OT also consulted.  GI bleed\n   appears stable at present; will continue to follow Hcts and clinical\n   signs while on PPI.   Will follow elevated lipase for now.

The apical lesion\n could be focal infection or pulmonary infarction.  Lung volumes are generally\n low and scattered areas of ground-glass opacification and are likely mild\n edema. Moderate volumes of non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions layer\n posteriorly, right slightly greater than left.\n\n There is no pathologic enlargement of central lymph nodes by size criteria,\n and no pericardial effusion.  The heart is top normal size.

Etiology broad and could\n   include infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely\n   given in hospital for 7 days, though had 65mg diazepam on 13th and 14th\n   as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan on 15th, and 1mg ativan on\n   the 16th, none since). Pt has involuntary shaking and documented eye\n   deviation to the left.   These are better today after keppra started.\n   LP done [**3-24**] showing no signs of infection at this point, but multiple\n   RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is concerning for HSV in\n   addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT on [**3-25**] shows 4mm subdural new\n   from [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**] growing staph, already on\n   vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern despite CT chest showing no\n   consolidation (does show bilateral pleural effusions).  He was started\n   on vanc/zosyn/cipro.  Less likely but possible is hepatic\n   encephalopathy.\n   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - conservative CIWA\n   - check CK given possible persistent seizures, ? rhabdo (Cr stable)\n   - lactulose 30 TID\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE\n   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.\n   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though\n   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is\n   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV\n   encephalitis, pleural effusions.  Withdrawal could also contribute to\n   tachycardia, though he is 1 week out from admission (though had 65mg\n   diazepam on 13th and 14th as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan\n   on 15th, and 1mg ativan on the 16th, none since).  Unlikely NMS given\n   only had .5 of haldol and 10mg of olanzapine during entire stay.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - CIWA\n   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: likely [**3-7**] sedation from keppra given nl pH\n   earlier today.  s/p intubation.\n   - wean as tolerated.\n   .\n   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could\n   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is\n   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on\n   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.\n   - repeat CT if changes in mental status, o/w, f/u for resolution in [**4-6**]\n   weeks.\n   .\n   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic\n   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent\n   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.\n   - consider thoracentesis\n   .\n   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has\n   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and\n   weakness.\n   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate\n   .\n   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak\n   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over\n   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.\n   - lasix\n   - goal negative\n   .\n   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay, hematocrit stable.\n   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.\n   .\n   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC\n   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k\n   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U\n   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])\n   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific\n   .\n   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never\n   given steroids.

Appendix measures up to 8mm and appears indistinct- any\n   evidence for acute appendicitis? Hypoattenuating liver may represent\n   fatty infiltration A few small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions are of\n   unclear etiology. Trace free fluid.\n   TTE: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with vigorous global\n   systolic function and high cardiac output. No significant valvular\n   disease or pulmonary hypertension.\n   MRI Spine [**3-21**]: 3. At L4/5, there is a left lateral disc protrusion\n   which contacts the left [**Name (NI) 5882**] nerve root in the moderately narrowed left\n   neural foramen\n   MRI Brain [**3-21**]: Minimal T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular white\n   matter abutting the lateral ventricles, which is a non specific\n   finding. While sometimes seen in asymptomatic patients, it also may\n   seen in demyelinating disease, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis or other\n   infectious/postinfectious states.\n   EMG [**3-22**]: Limited, abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence\n   for a moderate- to-severe generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy with\n   axonal features. Based on the limited data available, there is no\n   electrophysiologic evidence for a\n   demyelinating polyneuropathy, as in Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome\n   Assessment and Plan\n   A/P: 39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with\n   several months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought\n   to be due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers,\n   and concern for seizure.\n   .\n   ## AMS: This is worsened in past 2 days. Etiology broad and could\n   include infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely\n   given in hospital for 7 days, though had 65mg diazepam on 13th and 14th\n   as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan on 15th, and 1mg ativan on\n   the 16th, none since). Pt has involuntary shaking and documented eye\n   deviation to the left. Neurology consulted on floor and concerned for\n   seizure activity.  LP done yesterday showing no signs of infection at\n   this point, but multiple RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is\n   concerning for HSV in addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  He has had\n   no head imaging since an MRI head on [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**]\n   growing staph, already on vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern\n   despite CT chest showing no consolidation (does show bilateral pleural\n   effusions).  He was started on vanc/zosyn/cipro.\n   - CT head to r/u bleed, embolic event - shows small 4mm subdural.\n   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics, though can likely d/c cipro as\n   unsure of any benefit beyond zosyn.\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - CIWA\n   - check CK given possible persistent seizures, ? rhabdo (Cr stable)\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE\n   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.\n   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though\n   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is\n   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV\n   encephalitis, pleural effusions.  Withdrawal could also contribute to\n   tachycardia, though he is 1 week out from admission (though had 65mg\n   diazepam on 13th and 14th as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan\n   on 15th, and 1mg ativan on the 16th, none since).  Unlikely NMS given\n   only had .5 of haldol and 10mg of olanzapine during entire stay.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - CIWA\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: likely [**3-7**] sedation from keppra given nl pH\n   earlier today.  Low threshold to intubate if concern for inability to\n   protect airway.\n   - serial ABGs\n   .\n   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could\n   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is\n   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on\n   MRI from [**3-21**].\n   - vit k 10mg IV\n   - FFP\n   - serial CTs - if enlarging, neurosurgical involvement may be\n   necessary.\n   .\n   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic\n   effusions.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.\n   - consider thoracentesis in AM\n   .\n   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has\n   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and\n   weakness.\n   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate\n   .\n   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak\n   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over\n   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.\n   - lasix 20mg IV now\n   - goal negative\n   .\n   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay, hematocrit stable.\n   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.\n   .\n   ## Coagulopathy: PTT 43.7, INR 1.9.  ? hepatic contribution, possible\n   component of DIC (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])\n   - INR and PTT elevation, slight improvement\n   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U\n   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])\n   - ddimer and fibrinogen given worsening clinical picture since last\n   fibrinogen, which is also an acute phase reactant.  If suspicious for\n   DIC, look at smear.\n   - vit. K and FFP as above\n   .\n   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never\n   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.\n   - Liver recs (appreciate input)\n   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg\n   .\n   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808. Likely etoh related\n   subclinical pancreatitis.\n   - follow\n   - consider CT abd to eval for inflammation/pseudocyst\n   .\n   ## FEN/Lytes: Tube feeds, replete lytes prn\n   .\n   ## Prophylaxis: sc heparin, ppi\n   .\n   ## Access: PIVs\n   .\n   ## Code status: FULL CODE\n   .\n   ## Dispo: ICU\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren Pulmonary (Full) - [**2191-3-25**] 10:49 PM 55 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-3-25**] 11:59 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: SQ UF Heparin\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication: ICU consent signed Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: ICU\n.

Physician wrote a Nursing report that says: HPI-\n   39 y/o M with ETOH abuse who presented on [**3-18**] with lactic acidosis,\n   profound weakness and found to be severely thiamine deficient\n   consistent with a diagnosis of Beri Beri.  Pt was repleted aggressively\n   with Thiamine, MIV and had an NG placed for nutrition.  He developped\n   refeeding syndrome requiring agressive electrolyte repletion.  He\n   developed ETOH withdrawal and mental status changes approximately\n   24-48hr after admission.  He was treated with small doses of Valium and\n   mental status improved somewhat before he was called out to medicine on\n   [**3-21**].\n    Initially, pt was working with PT/OT and was evaluated by speech &\n   swallow.  On [**3-23**], he was advanced a dysphagia diet and the following\n   day, he spiked a fever to 101.8.  Initial infectious work up revealed\n   negative UA, neg Blood Cx, negative Cdiff and possible infiltrate on\n   CXR. Chest CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.\n   Lumbar puncture showed 2 WBCs, RBC 366, glucose 62 and protein 28.  Pt\n   was started on Vanc, Zosyn, Cipro for possible HAP/Asp PNA.\n   He triggered on [**2191-3-24**] for tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.  His\n   hypoxia resolved, and CTA was subsequently negative for PE.  Mental\n   status further deteriorated after fevers began and there was concern\n   for intermittent seizures due to bilateral upper extremity tremors and\n   periodic eye deviation.  2mg Ativan given without significant\n   improvement.  Pt was loaded with Keppra 1gram, started on Acyclovir\n   700mg IV TID and Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**].  Neuro attending recommended\n   transfer to MICU for continuous EEG monitoring.\n   Upon arrival to Micu, he was transported pt to head ct which was + for\n   small 4 mm subdural.. Throughout the night, ? r/t keppra dosing pt\n   became more somuent, acidotic and o2 dependant. He was intubated at\n   0230 for airway protection.\n   A/P: 39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with\n   several months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought\n   to be due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers,\n   and concern for seizure.\n   .\n   ## AMS: This is worsened in past 2 days. Etiology broad and could\n   include infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely\n   given in hospital for 7 days, though had 65mg diazepam on 13th and 14th\n   as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan on 15th, and 1mg ativan on\n   the 16th, none since). Pt has involuntary shaking and documented eye\n   deviation to the left. Neurology consulted on floor and concerned for\n   seizure activity.  LP done yesterday showing no signs of infection at\n   this point, but multiple RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is\n   concerning for HSV in addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  He has had\n   no head imaging since an MRI head on [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**]\n   growing staph, already on vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern\n   despite CT chest showing no consolidation (does show bilateral pleural\n   effusions).  He was started on vanc/zosyn/cipro.\n   - CT head to r/u bleed, embolic event - shows small 4mm subdural.\n   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics, though can likely d/c cipro as\n   unsure of any benefit beyond zosyn.\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - CIWA\n   - check CK given possible persistent seizures, ? rhabdo (Cr stable)\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE\n   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.\n   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though\n   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is\n   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV\n   encephalitis, pleural effusions.  Withdrawal could also contribute to\n   tachycardia, though he is 1 week out from admission (though had 65mg\n   diazepam on 13th and 14th as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan\n   on 15th, and 1mg ativan on the 16th, none since).  Unlikely NMS given\n   only had .5 of haldol and 10mg of olanzapine during entire stay.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - CIWA\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: likely [**3-7**] sedation from keppra given nl pH\n   earlier today.  Low threshold to intubate if concern for inability to\n   protect airway.\n   - serial ABGs\n.

Prior CT\n demonstrated left frontoparietal subdural fluid collection.\n\n COMPARISON:  CT dated [**2191-3-25**], and MR head dated [**2191-3-21**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, axial T2, gradient echo, FLAIR, and diffusion-\n weighted imaging was performed through the brain.  No contrast was\n administered.\n\n FINDINGS:  Again seen is a non-hemorrhagic extra-axial, subdural fluid\n collection in the left frontoparietal region.  This measures up to 4 mm.\n Retrospectively, on prior scan dated [**2191-3-21**], there was a similar\n collection, although slightly smaller in size measuring only 2 mm.  There are\n no parenchymal signal abnormalities appreciated, including no evidence of\n hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction.  The ventricles and\n sulci are normal in size and configuration.  There are no diffusion\n abnormalities detected within the brain parenchyma.  Major vascular flow voids\n are unremarkable.  The orbits are unremarkable.  The paranasal sinuses and\n mastoid air cells are normal.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Slight increase in left frontoparietal extra-axial, nonhemorrhagic fluid\n collection.  While the exact etiology is unclear, this can be seen in\n meningitis, and correlation is suggested.\n 2.  Otherwise normal MR examination of the brain with no evidence for\n hemorrhage, edema, masses, or infarction.\n\n\n.

acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n d/w with neuro re: d/c\n   acyclovir\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n discuss stopping continuous EEG\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - conservative CIWA\n not requiring\n   - d/c lactulose\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: fever low grade, trended down.  CTA negative for\n   PE.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: improved after intubations, no successfully\n   weaned.\n   - extubate\n   .\n   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could\n   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is\n   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on\n   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.\n   - MRI per neuro\n difficulty given continuous EEG.  Leads are\n   compatible, but staff unable to disconnect from box.  Either d/c\n   continuous EEG as above or need EEG nurse to help with disconnecting\n   box from leads\n   - f/u MRI\n   .\n   ## Anemia: up and down since admission. Likely at least partially from\n   nutritional issues including b12 deficiency (MCV 101) though also had\n   maroon guaiac pos stools during this admission.  No grossly bloody\n   stools at this point.\n   - guaiac stools\n   - recheck in PM\n   - further workup if still down this afternoon\n   - cont b vitamin supplementation\n   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic\n   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent\n   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.  Has\n   not seemed to directly effect respiratory status\n   - consider thoracentesis if no further improvement\n   .\n   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has\n   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and\n   weakness.\n   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate\n   .\n   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak\n   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over\n   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.\n   - lasix\n   - goal negative\n   .\n   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay.\n   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.\n   .\n   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC\n   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k\n   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U\n   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])\n   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific\n   - guaiac stools\n   .\n   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never\n   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.  Slight increased echogenicity\n   on RUQ, + ascites, mild splenomegaly.  Has GB sludge.\n   - Liver recs (appreciate input)\n   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg\n   - Lactulose discontinued as above\n   .\n   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808.

These are better today after keppra started.\n   LP done [**3-24**] showing no signs of infection at this point, but multiple\n   RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is concerning for HSV in\n   addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT on [**3-25**] shows 4mm subdural new\n   from [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**] growing staph, already on\n   vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern despite CT chest showing no\n   consolidation (does show bilateral pleural effusions).  He was started\n   on vanc/zosyn/cipro.  Less likely but possible is hepatic\n   encephalopathy.\n   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - conservative CIWA\n   - check CK given possible persistent seizures, ? rhabdo (Cr stable)\n   - lactulose 30 TID\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE\n   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.\n   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though\n   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is\n   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV\n   encephalitis, pleural effusions.

acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis\n d/w with neuro re: d/c\n   acyclovir\n   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural\n   effusions.\n   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics\n   - continuous EEG per neuro\n discuss stopping continuous EEG\n   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing\n   - conservative CIWA\n not requiring\n   - d/c lactulose\n   .\n   # Fever/tachycardia: fever low grade, trended down.  CTA negative for\n   PE.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: improved after intubations, no successfully\n   weaned.\n   - extubate\n   .\n   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could\n   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is\n   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on\n   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.\n   - MRI per neuro\n difficulty given continuous EEG.  Leads are\n   compatible, but staff unable to disconnect from box.  Either d/c\n   continuous EEG as above or need EEG nurse to help with disconnecting\n   box from leads\n   - f/u MRI\n   .\n   ## Anemia: up and down since admission. Likely at least partially from\n   nutritional issues including b12 deficiency (MCV 101) though also had\n   maroon guaiac pos stools during this admission.  No grossly bloody\n   stools at this point.\n   - guaiac stools\n   - recheck in PM\n   - further workup if still down this afternoon\n   - cont b vitamin supplementation\n   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic\n   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent\n   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.  Has\n   not seemed to directly effect respiratory status\n   - consider thoracentesis if no further improvement\n   .\n   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has\n   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and\n   weakness.\n   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate\n   .\n   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak\n   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over\n   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.\n   - lasix\n   - goal negative\n   .\n   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay.\n   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.\n   .\n   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC\n   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k\n   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U\n   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])\n   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific\n   - guaiac stools\n   .\n   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never\n   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.  Slight increased echogenicity\n   on RUQ, + ascites, mild splenomegaly.  Has GB sludge.\n   - Liver recs (appreciate input)\n   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg\n   - Lactulose discontinued as above\n   .\n   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808.

Physician wrote a Nursing report that says: 39 y/o M with ETOH abuse who presented on [**3-18**] with lactic acidosis and\n   profound weakness. He was found to be severely thiamine deficient\n   consistent with a diagnosis of Beri Beri.  Pt was repleted aggressively\n   with Thiamine, MIV and had an NG placed for nutrition.  He developed\n   re-feeding syndrome requiring aggressive electrolyte repletion.  He\n   developed ETOH withdrawal and mental status changes approximately\n   24-48hr after admission.  He was treated with small doses of Valium and\n   mental status improved somewhat before he was called out to medicine on\n   [**3-21**].\n    On [**3-23**], he was advanced a dysphagia diet and the following day, he\n   spiked a fever to 101.8.  Initial infectious work up revealed negative\n   UA, neg Blood Cx, negative Cdiff and possible infiltrate on CXR. Chest\n   CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.\n   He triggered on [**2191-3-24**] for tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.  His\n   hypoxia resolved, and CTA was subsequently negative for PE.  Mental\n   status further deteriorated after fevers began and there was concern\n   for intermittent seizures due to bilateral upper extremity tremors and\n   periodic eye deviation.  2mg Ativan given without significant\n   improvement.  Pt was loaded with Keppra 1gram, started on Acyclovir\n   700mg IV TID and Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**].  Neuro attending recommended\n   transfer to MICU for continuous EEG monitoring.\n   Upon arrival to MICU, he was transported pt to head ct which was + for\n   small 4 mm subdural.

CTA negative for\n   PE.  Other causes for fever that are noninfectious could include\n   atelectasis, pleural effusions, and dvt.\n   - cont antibiotics as above\n   - f/u cultures\n   - consider tapping pleural effusions\n   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement\n   - reimage RUQ given sludge\n   .\n   ## Differential UE edema: possible DVT\n   - LUE u/s\n   .\n   ## Respiratory acidosis: improved after intubations, no successfully\n   weaned and extubated.\n   .\n   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm by CT with no midline shift, though\n   could contribute to focus for seizure.  s/p vit k 10mg IV and FFP given\n   with improvement in INR. Repeat MRI shows no hemorrhage but increase in\n   an extra axial nonhemorrhage fluid collection which per radiology could\n   indicate meningitis.  She has negative LP for bacterial meningitis on\n   [**3-24**] with improvement since.\n   - MRI per neuro\n difficulty given continuous EEG.  Leads are\n   compatible, but staff unable to disconnect from box.  Either d/c\n   continuous EEG as above or need EEG nurse to help with disconnecting\n   box from leads\n   - f/u MRI\n   .\n   ## Anemia: up and down since admission. Likely at least partially from\n   nutritional issues including b12 deficiency (MCV 101) though also had\n   maroon guaiac pos stools during this admission.  No grossly bloody\n   stools at this point.\n   - guaiac stools\n   - recheck in PM\n   - further workup if still down this afternoon\n   - cont b vitamin supplementation\n   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic\n   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent\n   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.  Has\n   not seemed to directly effect respiratory status\n   - consider thoracentesis if no further improvement\n   .\n   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has\n   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and\n   weakness.\n   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate.  Change thiamine\n   to PO.\n   .\n   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak\n   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over\n   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.\n   - lasix\n   - goal negative\n   .\n   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay.  Guaiac negative in ICU.\n   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.\n   .\n   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC\n   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k\n   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U\n   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])\n   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific\n   - guaiac stools\n   .\n   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never\n   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.  Slight increased echogenicity\n   on RUQ, + ascites, mild splenomegaly.  Has GB sludge.\n   - Liver recs (appreciate input)\n   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg\n   - Lactulose and rifaximin\n   .\n   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808. Likely etoh related\n   subclinical pancreatitis.\n   - follow\n   - consider CT abd to eval for inflammation/pseudocyst\n   .\n   ## FEN/Lytes: Tube feeds, replete lytes prn\n   .\n   ## Prophylaxis: sc heparin, ppi\n   .\n   ## Access: PIVs\n   .\n   ## Code status: FULL CODE\n   .\n   ## Dispo: to floor\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-3-26**] 08:51 PM\n   20 Gauge - [**2191-3-26**] 08:52 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: sc heparin\n   Stress ulcer:  ppi\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition:\n.

PE not unlikely given LE edmea and signs\n   of right heart failure and unchanged CXR.  b/l Pleural effusions c/w\n   CHF, however.  Likely with significant component [**3-7**] to aspiration +/-\n   infection.  Will continue vanco/zosyn and add cipro for resistant\n   GNR's.  No clear benfefit to flagyl at this time.\n   - add-on BNP, diurese, sputum cultures, nebulizers\n   - Echo for systolic function, effusion, RV dysfunction.\n   - LE USD for DVT\n   - Obtain CTA chest to r/o PE when able, patient would have difficulty\n   tolerating overnight, and have other likely etiology for dyspnea.\n   - nebulizers, incentive spirometry when able\n   - Continue vanco/zosyn, add cipro for double coverage of GNR's given\n   acute decompensation and consider peeling off pending sputum, clinical\n   improvement, CXR findings.\n   - Trend CO2 for e/o hypercarbic respiratory failure and consider\n   intubation for worsening hypercarbia.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach by telemetry/ECG, no acute ST/Tchanges, but\n   with newly low voltage.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent lead placement/soft tissue\n   impedence changes, but would consider tamponade as cause for\n   tachycardia (although not hypotensive, no change on CXR).  More likely\n   [**3-7**] to fever, distress.\n   - Echo for e/o RV dysfunction, effusion, systolic function.\n   - pulsus of 10mmHg on exam, trend\n   - follow HR\n   - control pain, anxiety/air hunger.\n   - control fever curve\n   .\n   # Fevers: Pan-culture on arrival.  Clinically aside from tachycardia\n   and fever patient does not appear septic.  Lactic acid normal,\n   extensive cultures negative to date, and no leukocytosis.  Consider LP\n   given altered mental status, and consider thoracentesis given pleural\n   effusions although bilateral and h/o High output failure makes empyema\n   less likely.  Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.\n   Currently, unclear if patient would tolerate LP from respiratory\n   stand-point and may not cooperate with procedures (had to be held down\n   for previous LP).\n   - consider LP\n   - consider thoracentesis.\n   - pan-culture\n   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely\n   resistant GNR at this time.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro following\n   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV\n   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for\n   possible CNS infection.

Left pleural effusion.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are\nnormal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\nwall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal\n(LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no\naortic regurgitation. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased\ntransaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral\nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The\npulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function, with high cardiac output\nc/w a high output state (hyperthyroidism, shunt, anemia, etc).\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-3-18**], trivial\npericardial effusion is new.

Another triangular\n area of consolidation in the left upper lobe has appeared (3A:30), spanning\n 2.4 x 1.9 cm.  A patchy nodule of the anterior right upper lobe has increased\n to 5 mm (3A:47).\n\n The central airways are patent with the suggestion of some tracheomalacia\n given the appearance of the airway superiorly.  There is no axillary lymph\n node meeting CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement.

PE not unlikely given LE edmea and signs\n   of right heart failure and unchanged CXR.  b/l Pleural effusions c/w\n   CHF, however.  Possibly [**3-7**] to aspiration +/- infection.  Will continue\n   vanco/zosyn and add cipro for resistant GNR's.  No clear benefit to\n   flagyl at this time.\n   - add-on BNP, diurese, sputum cultures, nebulizers\n   - Echo for systolic function, effusion, RV dysfunction.\n   - LE USD for DVT\n   - Obtain CTA chest to r/o PE\n   - nebulizers\n   - Continue vanco/zosyn, add cipro for double coverage of GNR's given\n   acute decompensation and consider peeling off pending sputum, clinical\n   improvement, CXR findings.\n   - Trend CO2 for e/o hypercarbic respiratory failure and\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach by telemetry/ECG, no acute ST/Tchanges, but\n   with newly low voltage.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent lead placement/soft tissue\n   impedence changes, but would consider tamponade as cause for\n   tachycardia (although not hypotensive, no change on CXR).  More likely\n   [**3-7**] to fever, distress.\n   - Echo for e/o RV dysfunction, effusion, systolic function.\n   - pulsus of 10mmHg on exam, trend\n   - follow HR\n   - control pain, anxiety/air hunger.\n   - control fever curve\n   .\n   # Fevers: Pan-culture on arrival.  Clinically aside from tachycardia\n   and fever patient does not appear septic.  Lactic acid normal,\n   extensive cultures negative to date, and no leukocytosis.  Consider LP\n   given altered mental status, and consider thoracentesis given pleural\n   effusions although bilateral and h/o High output failure makes empyema\n   less likely.  Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.\n   Currently, unclear if patient would tolerate LP from respiratory\n   stand-point.\n   - consider LP\n   - consider thoracentesis.\n   - pan-culture\n   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely\n   resistant GNR at this time.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro following\n   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV\n   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for\n   possible CNS infection.\n   - Neurology recommended repeat LP on [**2191-3-31**]\n   - Original CSF profile not c/w CNS infection\n   - Check LFT's, consider lactulose rifaxamin although as per liver\n   unlikely cause for change in MS.\n   - Continue keppra, check level\n   - Consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: Last INR 1.8, partly nutritional with question of\n   underlying liver disease.  Was with etoh hepatitis earlier this admit.\n   - repeat LFT's\n   - FFP PRN\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   .\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, hold tube feeds for now, restart\n   when more stable.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin\n   .\n   # Access: peripherals\n   .\n   # Code: presumed full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient\n   .\n   # Disposition: pending above\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren 2.0 (Full) - [**2191-4-3**] 11:05 PM 55 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-4-3**] 01:53 PM\n   22 Gauge - [**2191-4-3**] 01:53 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n.

Currently he is receiving vanco/zosyn/cipro/flagyl\n   [**Hospital 6061**] hospital acquired pneumonia.\n   Action:\n   Cooling blanket placed over patient. Also ice packs were placed.\n   Tylenol 650mg po was given. The Tylenol was changed to do not exceed\n   2gm in 24hours.\n   Response:\n   Currently 101.7\n   Plan:\n   Monitor his temp frequently. Keep the cooling blanket on prn. The has a\n   order for the Tylenol. I did get the second blood culture. He was pan\n   cultured on admission to micu 6 secondary to his temps.\n   Dyspnea (Shortness of breath)\n   Assessment:\n   Respiratory rate 25to 30. He is a shallow breather, and has a poor\n   cough and gag. O2 sat while awake is 95-98% off the face mask. While he\n   is sleeping, his o2 sat will drop 90%. He is also on xopenon and\n   ipratropium q6 hours. Lung sounds clear bilat.\n   Action:\n   I did place him back on the face mask. Rt did given the HHN.\n   Response:\n   O2 sat now 100% on 40% fio2.\n   Plan:\n   Continue with the face mask and 40%.

Trop 0.04. ekg without ST changes noted. Icu team\n   feels the tachycardia is due to the fevers.\n   Action:\n   Tylenol given. Cooling blanket placed.\n   Response:\n   Heart rate went down to 135.\n   Plan:\n   Echo tomorrow. Continue with o2.\n   Labs\n   Assessment:\n   INR 2.1,potassium 3.6. ionized ca 1.11\n   Action:\n   Phytonadine 5gm po given, potassium 40meq given, and sliding scale\n   ionized ca given.\n   Response:\n   Temp max at 0500 102.3 Ax. Tylenol 650mg given and cooling blanket\n   placed. Potassium 3.7. magnesium 1.6. potsssium 40meq given and\n   magnesium 2gm iv given. HCT 23.7. which is down from 27.2. He did have\n   one large guiac positive stool. ICU team aware, and will discuess it in\n   rounds this am.\n   06:06\n. Physician wrote a Physician  report that says: TITLE: MICU Attending Progress Note\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr.\n   [**Last Name (STitle) 991**]\ns note above, including the assessment and plan. I would\n   emphasize and add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine\n   deficiency, weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea.\n   Overnight, HR 150s (ST) c Tm 103. LENIs negative, CXR s sig changes,\n   VBG 7.44/32/44.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103 BP 110/70 HR 131 RR 28 with sat 97 on FM.\n   Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is difficult to\n   understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+ edema. Labs\n   notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low volumes, R\n   effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage and gentle diuresis. Will recheck echo today and check pulsus\n   given lower volts on EKG. If above negative will check CTA to assess\n   effusions and possible PE. Suspect he remains weak despite treatment,\n   so will check NIF and VC today while following VBGs for component of\n   neuromuscular respiratory insufficiency. For fevers, will check manual\n   diff, amylase, lipase, LFTs, c.diff, sinus and abdominal CT. Continue\n   thamine for beriberi as well as nutritional support via NGT. Mental\n   status difficult to assess due to dysarthria, will follow exam and f/u\n   imaging. Will continue lactulose for element of hepatic encephalopathy\n   and keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

PE not unlikely given bilateral leg edema\n   and signs of right heart failure and unchanged CXR.  Bilateral pleural\n   effusions c/w CHF, although can\nt rule out possibility of infectious\n   pulmonary process given persistent fevers. Possibly [**3-7**] to chronic\n   aspiration +/- infection.  Will continue vanco/zosyn and add cipro for\n   resistant GNR's.  No clear benefit to flagyl at this time.\n   - Hemodynamically stable for now\n   - Trial of Lasix given anasarca and monitor for improvement of\n   respiratory status\n   - Obtain echo to evaluate systolic function, effusion, RV dysfunction.\n   - LE U/S to r/o DVT\n   - Obtain CTA chest to r/o PE; Will get CT head and torso together which\n   will also allow for evaluation for empyema/ abcesses/ other foci of\n   infection as pt may be chronically aspirating\n   - nebulizers\n   - Continue vanco/zosyn, add cipro for double coverage of GNR's given\n   acute decompensation and consider peeling off pending sputum, clinical\n   improvement, CXR findings.\n   - Continue following serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   - Check NIF and vital capacity\n   - Consider thoracentesis for symptomatic relief\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Sinus tach by telemetry/ECG, no acute ST/Tchanges, but\n   with newly low voltage.  [**Month (only) 51**] represent lead placement/soft tissue\n   impedence changes, but would consider tamponade as cause for\n   tachycardia (although not hypotensive, no change on CXR).  More likely\n   [**3-7**] to fever, distress. Clinically appears to have been adequately\n   volume-resuscitated, thus dehydration is unlikely as the source of\n   tachycardia.\n   - Echo for e/o RV dysfunction, effusion, systolic function.\n   - control pain, anxiety/air hunger.\n   - Control fever\n   .\n   # Fevers: Pan-cultured on arrival. Clinically aside from tachycardia\n   and fever patient does not appear septic.  Lactic acid normal,\n   extensive cultures negative to date, and no leukocytosis. [**Month (only) 51**] need\n   thoracentesis given very large bilateral pleural effusions to improve\n   respiratory status as well as r/o of empyema (although low suscipion).\n   Finished 10 day course of empiric abx for PNA.\n   Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that showed only 2\n   WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.  Skin exam not\n   showing any break-down thus decub ulcer is not the source of fever. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever low although in\n   differential. With a feeding tube in place, may have occult sinusitis.\n   High suspicion for ongoing aspiration given pt\ns somewhat somnolent\n   state and decreased ability to protect airways.\n   - Nasal wash/ oral hygiene\n   - consider thoracentesis.\n   - pan-culture\n   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely\n   resistant GNR at this time.\n   - CT scan of head and torso for foci of infection\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro following\n   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV\n   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for\n   possible CNS infection.\n   - Neurology recommended repeat LP on [**2191-3-31**]\n   - Original CSF profile not c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - Start Lactulose/rifaxamin although as per liver unlikely cause for\n   change in MS.\n   - Continue keppra, check level\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct stable.\n   - Check PM Hct\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - F/u Echo\n   - Keep an active Type and cross\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: Last INR 1.8, partly nutritional with question of\n   underlying liver disease.

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic\n   purposes.\n   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   .\n   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been\n   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].\n   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.\n   - Control pain, fever\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.\n   - Continue abx as above\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, spelnomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually\n   smaller now; no abscess.\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night. Was\n   transfused 1 u pRBC\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue keppra\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Unlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia as CVP ranging [**1-19**]. Hypervolemic\n   hyponatremia is equally unlikely given that pt was actually diuresed\n   overnight and pt wasn\nt hyponatremic before.\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro signed off\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease\n   and malnutrition.

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic\n   purposes.\n   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   .\n   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been\n   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].\n   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.\n   - Control pain, fever\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL.\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.\n   - Finished 10 day course of empiric abx for PNA.\n   Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that showed only 2\n   WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr.  Skin exam not\n   showing any break-down thus decub ulcer is not the source of fever. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever low although in\n   differential. With a feeding tube in place, may have occult sinusitis.\n   High suspicion for ongoing aspiration given pt\ns somewhat somnolent\n   state and decreased ability to protect airways.\n   - Nasal wash/ oral hygiene\n   - consider thoracentesis.\n   - pan-culture\n   - continue antibiotics, and add cipro for now although unlikely\n   resistant GNR at this time.\n   - CT scan of head and torso for foci of infection\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, last echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro following\n   - Unclear if PO adequate at this time, and would consider IV\n   supplementation if concern for absorption arises.\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  given fevers would consider LP to evaluate for\n   possible CNS infection.\n   - Neurology recommended repeat LP on [**2191-3-31**]\n   - Original CSF profile not c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - Start Lactulose/rifaxamin although as per liver unlikely cause for\n   change in MS.\n   - Continue keppra, check level\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct stable.\n   - Check PM Hct\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - F/u Echo\n   - Keep an active Type and cross\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: Last INR 1.8, partly nutritional with question of\n   underlying liver disease.

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Lasix x 1 again today for diuresis since pt is grossly volume\n   overloaded\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need bilateral thoracentesis for diagnostic and\n   therapeutic purposes. (Will give 2u FFP first to reverse coagulopathy)\n   - Continue nebulizers PRN, serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   - Tachycardia likely related to underlying process of fever, infection.\n   Hemodynamically stable currently.\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.\n   - Continue abx as above\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach\n need to discuss what this is with\n   radiology\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually\n   smaller now; no abscess.\n   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from yesterday\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   - F/u ID recs\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and\n   was transfused 1 u pRBC.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - Change PPI from Qday to [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Check seizure history and indications for continuing Keppra.\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Unlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia as CVP ranging [**1-19**].

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. CT s sinusitis, B\n   effusions, no clear evidence of pancreatic fluid collection. Seen by\n   neurosurg, repeat MRI with smaller nonenhancing collection. Echo -\n   hyperdynamic, small effusion. Good response to lasix, transfused 1u\n   PRBC, CVL placed.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 128 RR 28 with sat 97 on FM\n   7.48/31/168. TBB-700cc/24h, CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies\n   pain though speech is difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2\n   hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+\n   3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage, supplemental oxygen and gentle diuresis given effusions and\n   elevated CVP. For fevers, will tap effusions, f/u CT reads w/r/t\n   peripancreatic collection and discuss fluid sampling with ID. Will need\n   FFP x2 units prior to thoracenteses. Continue thamine for beriberi as\n   well as nutritional support via NGT. Mental status difficult to assess\n   due to dysarthria, will follow exam and f/u imaging, d/c keppra, and\n   check TSH/cortisol, especially given evolving hyponatremia. Will\n   consider lactulose for element of hepatic encephalopathy. For anemia,\n   likely combination of slow GIB and critical illness. Will continue to\n   follow serial HCT and maintain HCT >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**].\n   Remainder of plan as outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 50 min\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 775**], MD\n   on:[**2191-4-5**] 05:21 PM ------\n.

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need thoracentesis for diagnostic and therapeutic\n   purposes.\n   - Continue nebulizers, serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   .\n   # Sinus Tachycardia: hemodynamically stable at this time, pt has been\n   adequately volume resuscitated as CVP ranging [**1-16**].\n   - Echo neg for tamponade as above.\n   - Control pain, fever\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.\n   - Continue abx as above\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, spelnomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually\n   smaller now; no abscess.\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night. Was\n   transfused 1 u pRBC\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue keppra\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro signed off\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM.

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Lasix x 1 again today for diuresis since pt is grossly volume\n   overloaded\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need bilateral thoracentesis for diagnostic and\n   therapeutic purposes.

New nonspecific signal abnormality in the central pons, which may\n   represent a subacute infarction or central pontine myelinolysis.\n   Infectious\n   and inflammatory causes should also be considered. The location of this\n   lesion does not correspond to typical or atypical manifestations of\n   Wernicke\n   encephalopathy.\n   Assessment and Plan\n   This is a 39 y/o M w/ wet beri-beri now transferred to ICU for acute\n   tachycardia/dyspnea in setting of treatment for aspiration pneumonia.\n   .\n   # Tachypnea: Pt has a large bilateral pleural effusion which is likely\n   the main reason for tachypnea. Tachycardia likely related to underlying\n   process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable currently.  Pleural\n   effusion was drained yesterday. (2L total bilaterally)\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far)\n   **Investigation for other possible etiology of tachypnea/ tachycardia\n   so far:\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done\n no PE, although limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach ->> cannot be drained by IR (too risky due\n   to other overlying structures); will do an U/S and do a diagnostic para\n   if there is any ascites.\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: not abscess; but there is a\n   new nonspecific lesion in pons that is c/w central pontine myelinolysis\n   or subacute infarction\n MRA of brain ordered.\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs\n   - Continue Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro (for PNA/ also gives good CNS coverage\n   if + brain abscess)- On day 12 of 14 today\n   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from [**4-4**]\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and\n   was transfused 1 u pRBC.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - appreciate neuro recs\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuro\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   - TSH WNL\n   - Cortisol indeterminate; will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease\n   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT consult placed; try to get pt OOB\n   to chair\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), 2 peripherals\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents\n   .\n   # Disposition: pending above\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren 2.0 (Full) - [**2191-4-5**] 08:03 PM 55 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   18 Gauge - [**2191-4-3**] 01:53 PM\n   22 Gauge - [**2191-4-3**] 01:53 PM\n   Multi Lumen - [**2191-4-4**] 04:53 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided.

MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read\n   pending.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on\n   4LNC. CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is\n   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+\n   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low\n   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,\n   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated\n   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and\n   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?\n   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will\n   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as\n   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and\n   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better\n   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and\n   critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT and maintain HCT\n   >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**].

This bilateral pleural effusion, which\n   increased in size per most recent imaging, is most probably due to\n   heart failure from wet beri-beri, although an occult infectious process\n   such as an empyema cannot be excluded.\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done last night which showed no PE, although\n   limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   - A trial of small dose Lasix was undertaken yesterday for gentle\n   diuresis (pt responded with 1.5 L UOP in 3 hours)\n no definite\n   evidence of improvement in respiratory status, although pt has been\n   weaned down to 4L O2 by nasal cannula over the course of the night.\n   - Lasix x 1 again today for diuresis since pt is grossly volume\n   overloaded\n   - Likely, pt is a chronic aspirator and may have a PNA hidden by the\n   large pleural effusion. Will continue Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for empiric\n   coverage. Will need bilateral thoracentesis for diagnostic and\n   therapeutic purposes. (Will give 2u FFP first to reverse coagulopathy)\n   - Continue nebulizers PRN, serial VBGs to monitor resp status\n   - Tachycardia likely related to underlying process of fever, infection.\n   Hemodynamically stable currently.\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] need thoracentesis as above.\n   - Continue abx as above\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach\n need to discuss what this is with\n   radiology\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: fluid collection actually\n   smaller now; no abscess.\n   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from yesterday\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever.\n   - F/u ID recs\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and\n   was transfused 1 u pRBC.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - Change PPI from Qday to [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Check seizure history and indications for continuing Keppra.\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Unlikely hypovolemic hyponatremia as CVP ranging [**1-19**]. Hypervolemic\n   hyponatremia is equally unlikely given that pt was actually diuresed\n   overnight and pt wasn\nt hyponatremic before.\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   - Check TSH and Cortisol\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   - Neuro signed off\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease\n   and malnutrition.

Coronal and sagittal reformations were also obtained.\n\n FINDINGS:  Since [**2191-4-4**], multifocal consolidation significantly\n increased with dense almost complete consolidation of both lower lobes and\n bilateral fairly symmetric mostly perihilar and peribronchial consolidation in\n both upper lobes and right middle lobe.  Bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural\n effusions improved, now moderate.\n\n Prevascular lymph node is unchanged, up to 9 mm.  Other mediastinal lymph\n nodes are scattered but not enlarged using CT criteria.  A nasogastric tube in\n place.  A left PICC ends in the SVC.  Signs of anemia are suggested by\n relative hypodensity of intracardiac blood.

Tachycardia likely related to underlying\n   process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable currently.  Pleural\n   effusion was drained yesterday. (2L total bilaterally)\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far)\n   **Investigation for other possible etiology of tachypnea/ tachycardia\n   so far:\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done\n no PE, although limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach ->> cannot be drained by IR (too risky due\n   to other overlying structures); will do an U/S and do a diagnostic para\n   if there is any ascites.\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: not abscess; but there is a\n   new nonspecific lesion in pons that is c/w central pontine myelinolysis\n   or subacute infarction\n MRA of brain ordered.\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs\n   - Continue Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro (for PNA/ also gives good CNS coverage\n   if + brain abscess)- On day 12 of 14 today\n   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from [**4-4**]\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and\n   was transfused 1 u pRBC.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - appreciate neuro recs\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuro\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   - TSH WNL\n   - Cortisol indeterminate; will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease\n   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT consult placed; try to get pt OOB\n   to chair\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), 2 peripherals\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents\n   .\n   # Disposition: pending above\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses\n   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read\n   pending.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on\n   4LNC. CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is\n   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+\n   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low\n   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,\n   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated\n   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and\n   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?\n   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will\n   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as\n   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and\n   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better\n   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and\n   critical illness.

Tachycardia likely related to underlying\n   process of fever, infection. Hemodynamically stable currently.  Pleural\n   effusion was drained yesterday. (2L total bilaterally)\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far)\n   **Investigation for other possible etiology of tachypnea/ tachycardia\n   so far:\n   - Suspicion of PE: CTA was done\n no PE, although limited by motion.\n   - Suspicion of pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology (low voltage\n   on EKG): Echo showing normal systolic fxn, hyperdynamic. Small\n   pericardial effusion.\n   - NIF and Vital Capacity attempted to evaluate neuromuscular component\n   of tachypnea however pt was unable to tolerate it.\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Not\n   septic as pt maintaining BPs, lactic acid normal, negative cultures to\n   date, WBC WNL. Patient had LP previously this hospitalization that\n   showed only 2 WBC's, nml protein, nml glucose, and negative HSV pcr. No\n   rash or eosinophilia makes suspicion of drug fever lower although in\n   still differential.\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - Suspicion of occult sinusitis given the feeding tube, CT was\n   obtained: normal sinuses, no sinusitis\n   - Suspicion of occult infectious processes in lungs and abdomen, CT\n   torso was obtained: limited by motion, splenomegaly. 4.6x2.8x2.3 cm\n   fluid collection in stomach ->> cannot be drained by IR (too risky due\n   to other overlying structures); will do an U/S and do a diagnostic para\n   if there is any ascites.\n   - Suspicion of infectious process in the brain (fluid collection seen\n   on previous imaging), MRI with gad done: not abscess; but there is a\n   new nonspecific lesion in pons that is c/w central pontine myelinolysis\n   or subacute infarction\n MRA of brain ordered.\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs\n   - Continue Vanc, Zosyn and Cipro (for PNA/ also gives good CNS coverage\n   if + brain abscess)- On day 12 of 14 today\n   - f/u final reads of imaging studies from [**4-4**]\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Monitor pt\ns ability to protect airways given his waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]\n   mental status and extreme muscle weakness\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Hct slowly trending downward, 21.5 last night and\n   was transfused 1 u pRBC.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Current deterioration in setting of\n   respiratory distress and fever.  Impression on floor was for\n   multifactorial etiology [**3-7**] to beri-beri, infection, liver dysfunction\n   and possible seizure.  LP done earlier this admission: CSF profile not\n   c/w CNS infection\n   - appreciate neuro recs\n   - LFTs stable.\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuro\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] consider LP, EEG monitoring although exam is more c/w delerium.\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia:\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   - TSH WNL\n   - Cortisol indeterminate; will [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR 2.1 this AM. Likely due to alcoholic liver disease\n   and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT consult placed; try to get pt OOB\n   to chair\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), 2 peripherals\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents\n   .\n   # Disposition: pending above\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses\n   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read\n   pending.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on\n   4LNC. CVP 12-15. Frail, dysarthric man, denies pain though speech is\n   difficult to understand. CTA B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+\n   edema. Labs notable for WBC 7K, HCT 23, K+ 3.7, Cr 0.6. CXR with low\n   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,\n   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated\n   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and\n   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?\n   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will\n   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as\n   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and\n   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better\n   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and\n   critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT and maintain HCT\n   >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**].

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, HAP readmitted with fevers and tachypnea. B thoracenteses\n   yesterday, transudates. MRI with abnormality in pons, f/u MRI read\n   pending.\n   Exam notable for Tm 103.1 BP 120/70 HR 120-130 RR 28-32 with sat 97 on\n   4LNC. CVP 12-15.

CXR with low\n   volumes, R effusion, interstitial prominence.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory distress with broad antibiotic\n   coverage x 14 days (day 12 today) for nosocomial aspiration pneumonia,\n   supplemental oxygen, and gentle diuresis given effusions and elevated\n   CVP. For fevers, will f/u CT reads w/r/t peripancreatic collection and\n   discuss fluid sampling with ID and IR; will also check USG for ?\n   ascites. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial collection, and will\n   f/u repeat MRI re pons lesion. Continue thamine for beriberi as well as\n   nutritional support via NGT and check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim for low sodium and\n   latered mental status. Mental status and strength somewhat better\n   today, consult PT, OOB. For anemia, likely combination of slow GIB and\n   critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT and maintain HCT\n   >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**].

Hemodynamically stable\n   currently.\n   - f/u pleural fluid labs (transudative appearing so far, cultures NGTD)\n   - Infection work up as below\n   - Intubated [**4-7**] for resp distress, worsening ABG c/w fatigue\n   - BAL for worsening Chest CT findings\n F/U results\n if pos for\n   hemosiderin-laden Macros, then check ANCA, anti-basement membrane\n   - Attempt PSV/CPAP, wean sedation for NIF trial, keep TV low (400cc)\n   for poss ARDS\n   - Hold Tylenol\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage. Now\n   afebrile off all ATBx could represent drug fever\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - C. diff neg x 2\n   - fluid collection in stomach, however not amenable to drainage due to\n   location.\n   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;\n   hold off on working it up further\n   - pleural fluid labs\n so far NGTD\n   - D/c all antibiotics for ? drug fever\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion; unlikely since MRI brain did not show any bilateral\n   hypothalamic lesions, lesss likely\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies\n delirium from current\n   acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction and central pontine\n   myelinolysis.\n   - central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is okay,\n   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of\n   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it\n   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.\n   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure\n   activity on the floor\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s. Now improving to mid-130s\n   - Highest on differential is SIADH due to pulmonary processes; will\n   monitor Na for now and if worsens, do a trial of free water\n   restriction.\n   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   - Trend Cr\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue thiamine repletion\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver\n   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian (placed [**4-4**]), A-line\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents\n   .\n   # Disposition: Pending above, consider trach/PEG if no improvement by\n   next week\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   Multi Lumen - [**2191-4-4**] 04:53 PM\n   Arterial Line - [**2191-4-7**] 07:00 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n.

MRA is okay,\n   ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of\n   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate neuron recs; unfortunately, it\n   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.\n   - [**Name2 (NI) **] need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Continue Keppra until outpt f/u with neuron for question of seizure\n   activity on the floor\n   - Simplify medication list to minimize chance of medications affecting\n   mental status\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Was stable in low 130s.

Intubated, bronch / BAL\n   obtained. Fevers down off antibiotics, CXR improved with increased\n   PEEP.\n   Exam notable for Tm 99.8 BP 120/70 HR 100-110 RR 22 with sat 100 on VAC\n   470x12 10 0.5 ABG 7.36/46/151 CVP 12-15.

Labs notable for WBC 12K, HCT 24, K+\n   3.5, Cr 0.5.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with using low volume\n   approach; can transition to PSV 10/10. Await BAL results, check\n   ANCA/AGBM if +hemosiderin laden macs. For possible weakness, will check\n   NIF today. For fevers, will stop RTC Tylenol, while following fever\n   trend and culture data from BAL. Will hold off on drainage of\n   intracranial / intrabdominal collection. Continue thiamine for beriberi\n   as well as nutritional support via NGT. For anemia, likely combination\n   of slow GIB and critical illness. Will continue to follow serial HCT\n   and maintain HCT >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**].

Please revaluate left extra-\n axial fluid collection, and area of pontine signal abnormality.\n\n COMPARISON:  MRI from [**2191-4-4**], and MRA from [**2191-4-6**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging, including\n diffusion-weighted imaging, and post-contrast imaging.\n\n FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited by patient motion artifact.  Thin\n left convexity extra-axial fluid collection is unchanged in size and signal\n characteristics, again only well seen on FLAIR images, with no significant\n mass effect. Post- contrast images are motion degraded, limiting evaluation\n for enhancement in this region.\n\n There is no other sign of intracranial hemorrhage.  Ventricles and sulci are\n unchanged in size and configuration.\n\n Central pontine geographic focus of T2/FLAIR-hyperintensity is slightly more\n prominent and well-defined on today's examination, though this may be due, in\n part, to technical factors.  There is no definite enhancement in this region,\n and no evidence of restricted diffusion.  Increased signal on diffusion-\n weighted images corresponds to increased ADC map and FLAIR signal in this\n region, representing T2 \"shine-through\" artifact.\n\n Bilateral mastoid air cell opacification is not significantly changed.  The\n visualized marrow signal is normal.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  Unchanged small left subdural collection.  Evaluation for contrast\n enhancement is again technically limited by patient motion artifact.\n\n 2.  Slightly increased prominence of the geographic focal T2-signal\n abnormality in the central pons, which may relate to further evolution and/or\n technical factors; the appearance remains in keeping with central pontine\n myelinolysis, as suggested previously, which could be correlated with\n volume/serum osmolality shifts at time of its development. There is no\n evidence of extra-pontine myelinolysis.\n\n 3.  No new intracranial process.\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**2191-4-12**] 8:21 PM\n MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST                                        Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 54982**]\n Reason: assess interval change of extra-axial fluid collection previ\n Admitting Diagnosis: LIVER FAILURE\n  Contrast: MAGNEVIST Amt: 17\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n\n\n.

Trach placed [**4-11**].\n   - Will attempt trach mask trial\n   - Still awaiting BAL results (if pos for hemosiderin-laden Macros,\n   pathology still pending).  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results\n   pending.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,\n   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Also starting to become\n   hypertensive.\n   - stop captopril due to propensity to cause rashes\n   - start metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies\n chronic EtOH ingestion,\n   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,\n   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.\n   - potential central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is\n   okay, ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of\n   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it\n   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.\n   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium\n   component of his mental status.\n   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other\n   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and\n   agitation\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash\n f/u with Neuro\n   - continue nutritional support\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,\n   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all\n   antibiotics.  Fever last night could represent drug fever.  ID has\n   signed off, but will let them know that he is still spiking fevers.\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - Bronch\n BAL so far unrevealing.

However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.\n   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)\n   - RSV neg\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any\n   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been\n   stable over the last several days.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid\n   140s.\n   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   - Trend Cr\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver\n   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U\n   FFP [**4-11**] prior to trach/PEG)\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]\n   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped\n f/u with Neuro\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line, peripheral,\n   PICC to be placed\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.\n   .\n   # Disposition: Once Trach/PEG in place, ask case management to start\n   screening for placement.\n   - Family would like the patient to go to [**Hospital 189**] Rehab once medically\n   ready.\n   - Need to ask SW or case management to help file long-term disability\n   papers.\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren 2.0 (Full) - [**2191-4-11**] 05:22 PM 55 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   Arterial Line - [**2191-4-7**] 07:00 PM\n   16 Gauge - [**2191-4-11**] 04:00 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n.

Trach placed [**4-11**].\n   - Will attempt trach mask trial\n   - Still awaiting BAL results (if pos for hemosiderin-laden Macros,\n   pathology still pending).  ANCA and anti-GBM ordered and results\n   pending.\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to fever,\n   cardiomyopathy, and underlying central disease. Also starting to become\n   hypertensive.\n   - stop captopril due to propensity to cause rashes\n   - start metoprolol 12.5 mg TID and titrate upward as necessary\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Multiple etiologies\n chronic EtOH ingestion,\n   delirium from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction,\n   dry beri beri and central pontine myelinolysis.\n   - potential central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. MRA is\n   okay, ruling out ischemic etiology. Likely due to fast correction of\n   hyponatremia on admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it\n   an irreversible process. Can cause visual problems.\n   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium\n   component of his mental status.\n   - f/u neuro recs re: prognosis for cognitive recovery, any other\n   necessary tests for work up, and the use of zyprexa for discomfort and\n   agitation\n   - No need for lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash\n f/u with Neuro\n   - continue nutritional support\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,\n   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem) and was less febrile off all\n   antibiotics.  Fever last night could represent drug fever.  ID has\n   signed off, but will let them know that he is still spiking fevers.\n   **Investigation for infection source so far:\n   - Bronch\n BAL so far unrevealing. F/u on outstanding studies.\n   - C. diff neg multiple times\n   - fluid collection in stomach seen on imaging, however not amenable to\n   drainage due to location.\n   - small fluid collection extra-axially on MRI brain; not an abscess;\n   repeat MRI [**4-12**]\n   - pleural fluid labs\n so far NGTD\n   - Continue oral hygiene; check for skin break down\n   - Surveillance cultures\n   - Consider repeat LP if all the above investigations negative for\n   source of fever. However likely low yield, and pt is coagulopathic.\n   - Consider paracentesis, although not much ascitic fluid seen by U/S.\n   ([**Month (only) 51**] need IR for this)\n   - RSV neg\n   - F/u ID, neuro, and neurosurg recs\n   - [**Month (only) 51**] be central (CNS) in etiology, however it\ns a diagnosis of\n   exclusion; considered unlikely since MRI brain did not show any\n   bilateral hypothalamic lesions, however still in differential.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Pt has many reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness,\n   guaiac pos stools. Likely having a very slow GI bleed.  Hct has been\n   stable over the last several days.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI [**Hospital1 7**]\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid\n   140s.\n   - TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   - Trend Cr\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR stable around 2. Likely due to alcoholic liver\n   disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this admission.\n   - Will need Vit K and FFP before procedures to reverse coagulopathy (2U\n   FFP [**4-11**] prior to trach/PEG)\n   - follow Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]\n   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped\n f/u with Neuro\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.\n   - SW consult.\n   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on tube feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt.\n   .\n   # Access: Left subclavian removed (placed [**4-4**]), A-line, peripheral,\n   PICC to be placed\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.\n   .\n   # Disposition: Once Trach/PEG in place, ask case management to start\n   screening for placement.\n   - Family would like the patient to go to [**Hospital 189**] Rehab once medically\n   ready.\n   - Need to ask SW or case management to help file long-term disability\n   papers.\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition:\n   Nutren 2.0 (Full) - [**2191-4-11**] 05:22 PM 55 mL/hour\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines:\n   Arterial Line - [**2191-4-7**] 07:00 PM\n   16 Gauge - [**2191-4-11**] 04:00 PM\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT:\n   Stress ulcer:\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status:\n   Disposition:\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM\n   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU\n   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, respiratory distress readmitted with fevers and tachypnea.\n   Trach placed, PEG on hold due to trunk rash c/w drug reaction. Keppra\n   stopped, captopril on hold.\n   Exam notable for Tm 101.7 BP 120/70 HR 100-110 RR 22 with sat 100\n   on 8/0 0.4 c ABG 7.5/37/109. Follows commands, remains weak. Bronchial\n   BS B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+ edema. Labs notable for WBC\n   6K, HCT 23, K+ 3.6, Cr 0.4. CXR c confluent ASD B.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with PSV and TM\n   trials. Will f/u BAL results while holding antibiotics, and will check\n   ANCA/AGBM for component of hemorrhage, though this seems less likely.\n   For neuromuscular weakness, will continue to follow NIFs QD, and will\n   start PT/OT evaluation in preparation for rehab. Will d/c captopril\n   given progressive rash, and will initiate beta blocker for ongoing\n   hypertension and tachycardia. Will hold off on drainage of intracranial\n   / intrabdominal collection, but will check f/u head MRI with contrast\n   today to assess interval change. Fevers continue, possibly due to drug\n   reaction, will monitor off antibiotics for now. Continue thiamine for\n   beriberi as well as nutritional support via NGT. For anemia, likely\n   combination of slow GIB and critical illness. Will continue to follow\n   serial HCT and maintain HCT >21. Continue PNBTS, PPI [**Hospital1 7**]. Needs rehab\n   screening, will place PICC once fevers abate. Remainder of plan as\n   outlined above.\n   Patient is critically ill\n   Total time: 40 min\n   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 775**], MD\n   on:[**2191-4-12**] 02:22 PM ------\n.

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and\n   add the following points: 39M EtOH abuse, severe thiamine deficiency,\n   weakness, respiratory distress readmitted with fevers and tachypnea.\n   Trach placed, PEG on hold due to trunk rash c/w drug reaction. Keppra\n   stopped, captopril on hold.\n   Exam notable for Tm 100.9 BP 140/70 HR 100-110 RR 22 with sat 100\n   on TM 0.4 c ABG 7.5/37/109. Follows commands, remains weak. Bronchial\n   BS B. RRR s1s2 hyperdynamic. Soft +BS. 1+ edema. Labs notable for WBC\n   9K, HCT 24, K+ 3.9, Cr 0.4. CXR c confluent ASD B.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with PSV and TM\n   trials. Will f/u BAL results while holding antibiotics, and will check\n   ANCA/AGBM for component of hemorrhage, though this seems less likely.\n   For neuromuscular weakness, will continue to follow NIFs QD, and will\n   continue PT/OT evaluation in preparation for rehab. Will advance beta\n   blocker for ongoing hypertension and tachycardia. Suspect fevers and\n   rash are due to keppra, which we will add to his allergy list. Will f/u\n   head MRI read but would hope to avoid any drainage procedures. Continue\n   thiamine for beriberi as well as nutritional support via NGT. Continue\n   PNBTS, PPI QD, d/c Foley.

Likely due to\n   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this\n   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.\n   - follow coags/Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]\n   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement\n none to date\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.

I agree with the\n   note above, including the assessment and plan.

CXR c confluent ASD B.\n   Agree with plan to manage respiratory failure with ongoing TM\n   trials. For neuromuscular weakness, will continue PT/OT in preparation\n   for rehab. Will advance beta blocker for ongoing hypertension and\n   tachycardia. Suspect fevers and rash are due to keppra, which we added\n   to his allergy list. Continue thiamine for beriberi as well as\n   nutritional support via NGT. Continue PNBTS, PPI QD.

CXR\n   improved. Stable.\n   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%\n   - anti-GBM pending\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to\n   resolving high output  fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central\n   disease. Is staying normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.\n   - Captopril d/c\nd due to propensity to cause rashes\n   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID\n   .\n   # Altered mental status:  Appears to be improving. Multiple etiologies\n chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium from current acute illness, ICU\n   setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri beri and central pontine\n   myelinolysis seen MRI brain [**2191-4-5**]. Repeat MRI shows unchanged small\n   subdural defect and continued evolution of likely central pontine\n   myelinolysis. Likely due to fast correction of hyponatremia on\n   admission. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it\ns an irreversible\n   process. Can cause visual problems.\n   - Minimize sedating medications. Zyprexa may work better for delirium\n   component of his mental status.\n   - f/u neuro recs\n will follow up as outpatient\n   - Repeat MRI head\n essentially unchanged\n   - Cont to hold lactulose as patient is having large amounts of liquid\n   diarrhea\n   - Keppra stopped as potential cause for rash\n added to allergy list\n   - continue nutritional support\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,\n   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all\n   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug\n   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many\n   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely\n   resolving slow GI bleed.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI changed to qday\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s.

Likely due to\n   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this\n   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.\n   - follow coags/Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]\n   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal\n   involvement\n none to date\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more\n   likely to cause rash and fever)\n   .\n   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, stable on tube feeds.

TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   - Trend Na, Cr\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to\n   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this\n   admission. Needs Vit K and FFP prior to invasive procedures.\n   - follow coags/Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**]\n   - Derm input: watch for signs of mucosal involvement\n none to date\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction\n   .\n   # Etoh: Outside window for withdrawal.

Pt reports being in\nusoh until [**1-10**] when he began to notice right leg swelling and\nweakness.  This has slowly progressed to involve bilateral leg\nweakness and mild discomfort, as well as arm weakness, that he\ncannot describe further.  He was seen at [**Hospital1 778**] where he was\ntold\nthat his liver enzymes were elevated, and was started on\n\"vitamin supplementation\" although he is unsure exactly what\nkind.  He does report N/V 2 days ago, brought up iced tea that\nhe had recently drank.  No dark or bloody BMs; one BM per day.\nNo abd pain, fevers.  Does admit to \"swelling\" multiple\nextremities.

MSM lives with\npartner, Denies tobacco/IVDU. Drinks 5 vodka drinks/day. Tattoo\nfrom [**2178**].\n\nFamily History:\nNoncontributory\n\nPhysical Exam:\nICU Admission Exam:\nVitals: T: BP: P: R: 18 O2:\nGeneral: Alert, oriented, no acute distress\nHEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear\nNeck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD\nLungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,\nronchi\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,\ngallops\nAbdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,\nno rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly\nExt: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or\nedema\n\nPertinent Results:\nHead CT [**2191-3-17**]: No acute intracranial process.\n.\nCXR [**2191-3-17**]: No acute intrathoracic process.\n.\nCT abdomen [**2191-3-17**]: Diffuse esophageal wall thickening\nconsistent with esophagitis. Appendix measures up to 8mm and\nappears indistinct- any evidence for acute appendicitis?\nHypoattenuating liver may represent fatty infiltration A few\nsmall hypoattenuating hepatic lesions are of unclear etiology.\nTrace free fluid.\n.\nTTE [**2191-3-18**]: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with\nvigorous global systolic function and high cardiac output. No\nsignificant valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension.\n.\nCXR [**2191-3-20**]: The NG tube is coiled in the stomach with the tip\nin the mid\nstomach. There are new bilateral infiltrates in the left lower\nlobe and in\nthe right lower lobe with the left lower lobe infiltrate being\nmore densely opacified on the right.\n.\nMRI Spine [**3-21**]: 3. At L4/5, there is a left lateral disc\nprotrusion which contacts the left [**Name (NI) 5774**] nerve root in the\nmoderately narrowed left neural foramen\n.\nMRI Brain [**3-21**]: Minimal T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular\nwhite matter abutting the lateral ventricles, which is a non\nspecific finding. While sometimes seen in asymptomatic patients,\nit also may seen in demyelinating disease, Lyme disease,\nsarcoidosis or other infectious/postinfectious states.\n.\nEMG [**3-22**]: Limited, abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic\nevidence for a moderate- to-severe generalized sensorimotor\npolyneuropathy with axonal features. Based on the limited data\navailable, there is no electrophysiologic evidence for a\ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, as in Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome\n.\nCXR [**3-24**]: Left lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia with\nparapneumonic effusion given history.\n.\nCT chest [**3-24**]: 1. Mild pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral\npleural effusions. 2. Solitary focus of infection or small\ninfarction right upper lobe. Followup with routine chest\nradiographs recommended.\n3. Bibasilar consolidation is more likely atelectasis than\npneumonia.\n.\nBilateral LENIs [**3-25**]: No evidence of DVT in either lower\nextremity.\n.\nEEG [**3-25**]: Largely normal EEG for wakefulness and drowsiness.\nThere\nwas plentiful movement artifact, obscuring large portions of the\n\nbackground. There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and\nthere were no epileptiform features.\n.\nCTA chest [**3-25**]: 1. No PE to the segmental level.\n2. Moderate bilateral effusions with associated compression\natelectasis are unchanged since yesterday.\n3. Right apical lung lesion may represent infection or infarct\nbut should be followed after therapy to ensure resolution or\nstability.\n.\nCT head [**3-25**]: While the study is very limited by motion, a new\nsmall isodense left frontoparietal subdural collection could\nrepresent subacute hemorrhage.\n.\nCXR [**3-26**]: The ET tube is 5.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube is\nin the stomach. There is a moderate left effusion and left\nretrocardiac\nopacification consistent with volume loss/infiltrate. Compared\nto the prior study, the left effusion is increased in size.\n.\nRUQ US [**3-26**]:\n1. Mild splenomegaly. Slightly increased liver echogenicity.\n2. Ascites.\n3. Right pleural effusion.\n4. Mildly distended gallbladder, containing thick bile/sludge,\nwhich can be seen in the prolonged fasting state.\n.\nCXR [**3-27**]: Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, stable on the\nleft, increased on the right since [**3-26**]. Upper lungs\nclear. Heart size normal. ET tube and nasogastric tube in\nstandard placements. No radiopaque central venous catheter is\nnoted. Right apical lung lesion seen on recent chest CT and CTA\nscans is not clearly visible on conventional bedside radiographs\nsuggesting it is not enlarging rapidly, but followup is\nindicated.\n.\nLeft UE US [**3-28**]: No evidence of left upper extremity deep venous\nthrombosis.\n.\nCXR [**3-29**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-27**], the nasogastric\ntube has\nbeen removed and replaced with a Dobbhoff tube that extends to\nthe mid body of the stomach. Endotracheal tube has been removed.\nThe bilateral hazy opacification consistent with pleural fluid\nis seen at both bases. It appears to be less prominent, though\nsome of this could reflect the upright rather than supine\nposition.\n.\nCXR [**3-30**]: Left lower lobe consolidation has been present since\nit developed between [**3-18**] and [**3-20**] could be\npersistent pneumonia, or alternatively atelectasis. Moderate\nright and small left pleural effusion have increased since\n[**3-29**], though heart size is normal and unchanged. No\npneumothorax. Feeding tube ends in the stomach.\n.\nEcho [**4-4**]:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall\nleft ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The\nestimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There\nis no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic\nvelocity is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral\nvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not\nbe determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function, with high\ncardiac output c/w a high output state (hyperthyroidism, shunt,\nanemia, etc).\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-3-18**],\ntrivial pericardial effusion is new. Other findings are similar.\n\n.\nCTA Chest, CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast [**2191-4-4**]:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Slightly limited study,\nparticularly in the upper lobes.\n2. Large bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions are\nincreased. There is no CT evidence to suggest empyema (no thick\nor enhancing pleura).\n3. Worsened consolidation in the left upper lobe, suggestive of\nworsening\npneumonia. A nodular opacity in the right upper lobe is\ndecreased in size,\nbut follow up to complete resolution is recommended. Followup\nmay be obtained when treatment concludes and the patient's\nclinical condition improves.\n4. Possible tracheomalacia, though this is not a dedicated study\nto evaluate for this.\n5. Collection of fluid posterior to the pancreatic body as\ndescribed, new\nfrom the prior study of [**3-17**], most likely a locule of\nascites fluid\nrather than a discrete collection. There is a clear fat plane\nbetween this\nfluid and the pancreas. The pancreas is unremarkable in\nappearance with\nhomogeneous enhancement.\n5. Splenomegaly, with the spleen increased in size comparing to\n[**3-17**] (15 cm today versus 11.5 cm previously).\nProminent/enlarged liver.\n6. New small amount of ascites fluid.\n7. Increased gallbladder distention. There is concern for\ngallbladder\npathology, consider dedicated son[**Name (NI) 867**].\n.\nCT Head [**2191-4-4**]\nIMPRESSION: Normal CT of the sinuses. No evidence of sinusitis.\n.\nMRI brain [**2191-4-5**]\n1. Small subdural collection along the left convexity has\ndecreased in size, but increased in complexity and viscosity.\nEvaluation for associated contrast enhancement is technically\nlimited.\n2. New nonspecific signal abnormality in the central pons, which\nmay\nrepresent a subacute infarction or central pontine myelinolysis.\nInfectious and inflammatory causes should also be considered.\nThe location of this lesion does not correspond to typical or\natypical manifestations of Wernicke encephalopathy.\n.\nMRA brain [**2191-4-6**]\nApparent short-segment stenosis in the distal right vertebral\nartery, immediately proximal to the basilar artery origin, which\nmay be\nartifactual. The basilar artery and other major intracranial\narteries appear patent.\n.\nCT chest [**4-7**]\nWorsening bilateral symmetrical mostly perihilar consolidation\nin both\nupper lobes and right middle lobe, likely due to pulmonary\nedema. Extensive consolidation within both lower lobes could\npotentially reflect developing ARDS. Multifocal rapidly\nprogressing multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary hemorrhage are\nalso in the differential. Improvement of bilateral\nnonhemorrhagic pleural effusions, now moderate. Possible anemia.\nAscites.\n.\nCXR [**4-12**]\nIn comparison with the study of [**4-11**], there is little overall\nchange\nin the bilateral ground-glass densities compatible with\ncongestive failure. Bilateral pleural effusions persist. The\nleft subclavian catheter has been removed. Tracheostomy tube and\nDobbhoff tube remain in place.\n.\nMRI head [**4-12**]:\n1. Unchanged small left subdural collection. Evaluation for\ncontrast\nenhancement is again technically limited by patient motion\nartifact.\n2. Slightly increased prominence of the geographic focal\nT2-signal\nabnormality in the central pons, which may relate to further\nevolution and/or technical factors; the appearance remains in\nkeeping with central pontine myelinolysis, as suggested\npreviously, which could be correlated with volume/serum\nosmolality shifts at time of its development. There is no\nevidence of extra-pontine myelinolysis.\n3. No new intracranial process.\n.\nCXR [**4-14**]:\nTracheostomy tube tip terminates 2.5 cm above carina and feeding\n\ntube remains within the proximal stomach. Cardiac silhouette is\nenlarged but unchanged in size, and there is persistent vascular\nengorgement accompanied by bilateral confluent perihilar\nopacities likely representing widespread, but slightly improving\npulmonary edema. Layering bilateral moderate pleural effusions\nare present, right greater than left.\n\nLABS:\n\n[**2191-4-1**] 07:15AM BLOOD WBC-7.3 RBC-2.50* Hgb-8.5* Hct-25.0*\nMCV-100* MCH-33.9* MCHC-34.0

He had components of both wet and dry: high output heart\nfailure, edema and severe weakness.  The patient was repleted\naggressively with Thiamine, a multivitamin, and had an NG placed\nfor nutrition. He developed refeeding syndrome requiring\nagressive electrolyte repletion. He developed ETOH withdrawal\nand mental status changes approximately 24-48hr after admission.\nHe was treated with small doses of benzos and mental status\nimproved somewhat before he was called out to the general\nmedicine team on [**3-21**]. Initially, the patient was working with\nPT/OT and was evaluated by speech & swallow. On [**3-23**], he was\nadvanced a dysphagia diet and the following day, he spiked a\nfever to 101.8. Initial infectious work up revealed negative UA,\nneg Blood Cx, negative Cdiff and possible infiltrate on CXR.\nChest CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.\nLumbar puncture showed 2 WBCs, RBC 366, glucose 62 and protein\n28. The patient was started on Vanc, Zosyn, and Cipro for\npossible HAP/Asp PNA. He triggered on [**2191-3-24**] for tachypnea,\ntachycardia, and hypoxia. His hypoxia resolved, and CTA was\nsubsequently negative for PE. Mental status further deteriorated\nafter fevers began and there was concern for intermittent\nseizures due to bilateral upper extremity tremors and periodic\neye deviation. 2mg Ativan was given without significant\nimprovement. The patient was loaded with Keppra 1gram, started\non empiric Acyclovir 700mg IV TID and Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **]. The\nneurology attending recommended transfer to MICU where he had\ncontinuous EEG monitoring.\n\nAfter Keppra loading the patient became more somnolent and\nacidotic and required intubation for airway protection. CT\nrevealed a small 4mm subdural hematoma but follow up MRI showed\nresolution. ABGs improved quickly on the vent and the patient\nwas easily awakened and extubated on [**3-27**]. He continued to be\ndysarthric, have low grade fevers and tachycardia to 90s-110s.\nHe was continued on Vanc/Zosyn for presumed aspiration pneumonia\nbut no positive cultures.  The 24hr EEG monitoring was been\ndiscontinued, NGT was removed and the patient was taking some\nmeds crushed in apple sauce and was advanced to dysphagia diet.\n\nUpon return to the medicine floor, the patient continued to have\nfluctuating mental status, occasional tachycardia and\ntemperatures, presumed to be related to repeated aspiration\npneumonitis. All cultures continued to be negative.  The patient\nhad a dobhoff tube placed for primary nutrition with tube feeds\nand eventually was restarted on pureed oral feeding only when\nalert and awake. The patient was again transferred to the ICU\nfor tachycardia and tachypnea that did not resolve with\nnon-rebreather treatment, and with fevers to 102F.\n\n## Weakness: On initial presentation the patient was\nquadraplegic. With thiamine repletion he improved to extremity\nstrength of [**4-6**]/5 and plateaued at this strength. He was seen by\nPT and OT while in house and discharged to [**Hospital 98**] rehab for\naggressive rehabilitation.\n\n## AMS: When initially hospitalized, pt had been completely\nalert and oriented. His mental status then deteriorated and\nfluctuated, consistent with delirium. Possibile etiologies are\nbroad and ultimately much of his mental status changes were\nattributed to infection and central pontine myelinolysis. The\nconsidered possibilities included:\n1) Aspiration PNA - despite CT chest showing no consolidation\n(does show bilateral pleural effusions), the patient completed a\ncourse of Vancomycin and Zosyn. There was concern for repeated\naspiration pneumonitis to explain occasional fevers, tachycardia\nand fluctuating mental status.\n2) Seizures: The patient was noted to have involuntary upper\nextremity shaking and eye deviation to the left. He had multiple\nrisk factors for seizures (ie cerebellar atrophy) but has had\nrepeated EEGs without findings consistent with seizure. He was\nloaded and maintained on Keppra for several weeks. However,\nultimately keppra was found to be a cause of drug rash and\nfevers, and neurology was not highly suspicious of seizure\nactivity in this patient. Thus keppra was discontinued.\n3) Meningitis/encephalitis: In the setting of fever and AMS but\nno meningeal signs, the patient had a lumbar puncture which was\ninconsistent with bacterial infection or HSV.  Empiric treatment\nwith broad antibiotics and acyclovir were stopped after\nconfirmed LP findings.\n4) Intracranial bleed or infarct: CT head with 4mm frontal SDH,\nbut follow up MRI had no sign of bleed. This was thought to be\neither artifact or transient SDH secondary to LP in setting of\nelevated INR. A repeat MRI did show ongoing small subdural\ncollection, but per neurology, this was unlikely to be\ncontributing to the patient's poor mental status. A neurosurgery\nconsult was obtained, and they did not recommend drainage of\nthis collection.\n5) Withdrawal: The patient was initially treated for withdrawal\nbut mental status deteriorated after he stopped [**Doctor Last Name **] on the\nCIWA scale. Once about 7 days after his last etoh ingestion,\nbenzos were stopped out of concern for delirium.\n6) Wernickes: Deemed unlikely given his initial presention with\nnormal MS. Also no findings on MRI of mammilary body\nabnormality.\n7) Hepatic encephalopathy: Given pt's alcohol hepatitis, he was\ntreated with lactulose and rifaximin for possible contribution\nof encephalopathy to altered mental status. Once LFTs returned\nto near normal, these meds were stopped, but waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]\nmental status persisted.\n8) Pellagra: Per case reports, Niacin deficiency in setting of\nthiamine repletion has been known to cause altered mental status\nand shaking. Pt received niacin repletion via his tube feeds,\nwhich contained 220% of daily niacin requirement.\n9) Central Pontine Myelinolysis: Lesion was found on MRI [**2191-4-5**]\nin the setting of ongoing altered mental status. An MRA was\nobtained to definitively rule out stroke as cause of this\nlesion, and MRA was normal. Per neurology, he likely has CPM due\nto rapid correction of hyponatremia earler in his hospital\ncourse. CPM is an irreversible process, and neurology consult\nattributed his mental status to CPM; however the patient was\nquite alert and oriented on the days immediately prior to\ndischarge, which indicates that he has not suffered an\nirreversible insult.\n\n## Respiratory Failure: Upon second transfer to the ICU, the\npatient was tachycardic and tachypneic. LENIs were negative for\nDVT and suspicion for pulmonary embolus was low. An ECHO was\nobtained which showed hyperdynamic systolic function with a\nsmall pericardial effusion and large bilateral pleural\neffusions, likely related to his wet Beri-Beri. He was started\non vancomycin/zosyn/ciprofloxacin for presumed  aspiration\npneumonia. He was diuresed with IV lasix boluses and he\nunderwent needle thoracentesis bilaterally on [**2191-4-5**]. Pleural\nfluid was transudative and cultures were negative. The patient\nwas intubated for tachypnea and fatigue on [**2191-4-7**], likely in the\nsetting of extreme weakness due to BeriBeri and underwent\nbronchoscopy that same day. His airways showed normal anatomy\nand mucosa. He had RML and RUL bronchoalveolar lavage, which\nreturned mildly bloody fluid. This BAL fluid was negative for\ninfection and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Ultimately the\npatient's antibiotics were discontinued on [**2188-4-5**] because\ninfectious workup for pneumonia was negative, and these\nmedications were thought to be contributing to his fevers. He\nhad a repeat mini-bronchoalveolar lavage on [**4-11**], and again BAL\nfluid was negative for infection. The patient underwent\ntracheostomy on [**2191-4-11**] and was able to be weaned to trach mask\nventilation on [**2191-4-13**]. He had a Passy-Muir valve placed on [**4-13**]\nto enable better speech.\n\n## Fevers: Upon second transfer to ICU, the patient was febrile\nand his fevers persisted despite antibiotic therapy and an\nextensive infectious work-up. Ultimately, per ID consult, fever\nwas attributed to medications, and the patient deffervesced when\nall antibiotics and keppra were discontinued.  He subsequently\ndeveloped low grade fevers several days later which have\ncontinued.  A repeat infectious work-up was negative and his\nmental status slowly cleared.  His recurrent fevers are likely\nrelated to his underlying CNS injury and may still have a\nmedication component.  If the patient develops a fever at rehab,\nthis is likely due to the above, rather than a new infection,\nand should not automatically precipitate transfer back to the\nhospital.\n\n## Drug Rash: The patient developed a wide-spread, erythematous,\nconfluent macular rash on [**4-12**]. A dermatology consult was\nobtained, and the rash was attributed to a drug reaction. Keppra\nand captopril were thought to be most the likely causes of the\nrash, and both were discontinued.  The rash had largely resolved\nby the time of discharge, and the patient should be considered\nallergic to keppra.\n\n## Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated PTT and INR thought\nto be due to liver dysfunction and severe nutritional\ndeficiency.  He had no evidence of DIC or active bleeding. He\nreceived Vit K and FFP while in the ICU for possibility of\nsubdural hematoma and prior to invasive procedures.  He also\nreceived a total of 6 units of pRBCs for Hct <21.\n\n## Volume status: The patient was consistently extravascularly\nfluid overloaded, due to hypoalbuminemia from malnutrition,\nberiberi related capillary leak, and initial aggressive fluid\nresuscitation for tachycardia of unknown source. He was diuresed\nwith occasional IV lasix until he appeared euvolemic.\n\n## Anemia: The patient was found to have a macrocytic anemia due\nto malnutrition and alcohol effects. He was treated with B12 and\nfolate repletion. His hct has remained stable around 25. He was\nalso found to have guaiac positive stools. He was maintained on\na PPI and was transfused keep hct >21%.\n\n## Tachycardia: Patient was tachycardic in 110s-120s for much of\nhis hospital course, likely due to his high-output cardiac\nfailure from wet BeriBeri and persistent fevers. Ultimately he\nwas placed on metoprolol with great improvement in his heart\nrate to the 90s. Metoprolol 25mg TID should be continued as long\nas he remains tachycardic, unless he becomes hypotensive to\nSBP<100.\n\n## Hyponatremia: The patient was hyponatremic throughout much of\nhis hospital stay. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency were\nruled out as possible etiologies. This was likely due to SIADH\nin the setting of multiple pulmonary processes, and his sodium\nhad corrected by [**2191-4-7**] and has since remained stable.\n\n## LFT abnormalities: On presentation the patient had LFT\nabnormalities consistent with alcoholic hepatitis and\npancreatitis. Both improved throughout the admission.\n\n## Nutrition: The patient was given tube feeds via gastric\ndobhoff. On the day prior to discharge he had a PEG placed at\nthe bedside. This PEG can be used for tube feeds starting in the\nafternoon of [**4-16**]. This PEG should not be removed until after\n[**2191-5-16**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Received trach/PEG and\n   now clinically improved.\n   .\n   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**].\n   Doing well on trach mask.\n   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%\n   - anti-GBM negative\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to\n   resolving high output fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central\n   disease. Is staying normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.\n   - Captopril d/c\nd due to propensity to cause rashes\n   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID\n   .\n   # Altered mental status: Much improved now. Alert and oriented x 3 and\n   appropriate.  Multiple etiologies\n chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium\n   from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri\n   beri and central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI which was likely due to\n   fast correction of hyponatremia on admission. Repeat MRI essentially\n   the same. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it\ns an irreversible\n   process. Can also cause visual problems.\n   - f/u neuro recs\n will follow up as outpatient\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,\n   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all\n   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug\n   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many\n   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely\n   resolving slow GI bleed.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI changed to qday\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid\n   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to\n   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this\n   admission. Received 2U FFP prior to PEG yesterday. Needs Vit K and FFP\n   prior to invasive procedures.\n   - follow coags/Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**].\n   Now resolving\n   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal\n   involvement\n none to date\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more\n   likely to cause rash and fever)\n   .\n   # FEN: Replete electrolytes. PEG ok for meds only until afternoon\n   today. Then can start Tube Feeds.\n   .\n   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI; PT working with pt\n OOB to chair\n   .\n   # Access: PIV\n   .\n   # Code: full\n   .\n   # Communication: Patient/ Parents.\n   .\n   # Disposition: Trach and PEG in place.

Received trach/PEG and\n   now clinically improved.\n   .\n   # Tachypnea / Respiratory distress: Extubated and trach placed [**4-11**].\n   Doing well on trach mask.\n   - Cont trach mask to keep O2 sats > 93%\n   - anti-GBM negative\n   .\n   # Tachycardia: Not fluid responsive. Stable. Likely related to\n   resolving high output fever, cardiomyopathy, and underlying central\n   disease. Is staying normotensive. Responding well to metoprolol.\n   - Captopril d/c\nd due to propensity to cause rashes\n   - Continue metoprolol 25 mg TID\n   .\n   # Altered mental status: Much improved now. Alert and oriented x 3 and\n   appropriate.  Multiple etiologies\n chronic EtOH ingestion, delirium\n   from current acute illness, ICU setting, liver dysfunction, dry beri\n   beri and central pontine myelinolysis seen MRI which was likely due to\n   fast correction of hyponatremia on admission. Repeat MRI essentially\n   the same. Appreciate Neuro recs; unfortunately, it\ns an irreversible\n   process. Can also cause visual problems.\n   - f/u neuro recs\n will follow up as outpatient\n   .\n   # Fevers: Persistent fevers despite broad spectrum abx coverage (cipro,\n   flagyl, vanc, zosyn -> meropenem). Extensive infectious work up all\n   negative. Became less febrile off all antibiotics, which is c/w drug\n   fever.  ID agrees w/ drug fever.\n   .\n   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 23-25 over past several days. Pt has many\n   reasons to be anemic; malnutrition, illness, guaiac pos stools. Likely\n   resolving slow GI bleed.\n   - Maintain Hct >21\n   - Keep an active type and cross\n   - PPI changed to qday\n   .\n   # Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Was stable in low 130s. Now improved to mid\n   140s. TSH WNL and appropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test\n   .\n   # Beri-Beri: Dry/Wet features, echo hyperdynamic.\n   - Continue B vitamins at increased doses, incl thiamine and pyridoxine\n   .\n   # Coagulopathy: INR normalizing without treatment to 1.7. Likely due to\n   alcoholic liver disease and malnutrition. Vit K given during this\n   admission. Received 2U FFP prior to PEG yesterday. Needs Vit K and FFP\n   prior to invasive procedures.\n   - follow coags/Hct.\n   .\n   # Rash: developed raised, blanchable lesions trunk > extremities [**4-10**].\n   Now resolving\n   - Derm input: likely drug reaction; watch for signs of mucosal\n   involvement\n none to date\n   - Keppra and captopril stopped for possible drug reaction (Keppra more\n   likely to cause rash and fever)\n   .\n   # FEN: Replete electrolytes.
